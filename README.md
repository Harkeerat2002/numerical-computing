# Workspace Overview

This workspace contains several projects related to mathematical computations and simulations. Each project has its own set of files and data.

## Projects

- **Project 1**: PageRank Algorithm and Social Networks
- **Project 2**: Graph Partitioning
- **Project 3**: Spectral Graph Clustering
- **Project 4**: Image Deblurring and Conjugate Gradient Solver
- **Project 5**: Linear Programming and the Simplex Method
- **Project Bonus**: Least Squares for Real-World Problems

## Running the Code

Most of the code in these projects is written in MATLAB. To run a MATLAB script (`.m` file), you'll need to have MATLAB installed on your machine. Here's a general way to run MATLAB scripts:

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script you want to run.
3. Type the name of the script in the MATLAB command window and press Enter.
